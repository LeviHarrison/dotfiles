# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles for Neovim and tmux.

`init.vim` - Contains my plugins and settings for Neovim. Inspired by [awesome-streamerrc](https://github.com/awesome-streamers/awesome-streamerrc).

`.tmux.conf` - Contains a custom theme I wrote for tmux, using the colors from the Dracula theme, but otherwise completely different. It also has some key bindings.
